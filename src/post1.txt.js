In the dynamic field of software development, architectural decisions significantly shape project execution. We're often caught between two popular paradigms ~ Monolithic and Microservice architectures. {{img1}} A team project I am currently working on, Community Compass, called for an architecture promoting independent work, scalability, expansion ease, and speed, steering us towards microservices.

Microservice architecture consists of independently developed and operated services. This design provides substantial independence, allowing each service to be modified separately without disrupting the system, facilitating parallel development allowing us to enhance throughput. Each service can also scale individually, surpassing the necessity of scaling the entire application. However, this architecture demands well-defined inter-service communication protocols.

A monolithic architecture has all system components functioning under a single entity, potentially limiting team independence and posing scalability challenges. Changes in one system part may affect others, leading to a ripple effect of issues.

Upon evaluating both against our project needs, we found microservice architecture to be the ideal choice due to its superior scalability and enhanced development independence. We can see the use of microservices in our base architecture diagram below. {{img2}} This architecture, catering to our project's tight timelines, allows concurrent work on individual components with everyone taking control of a certain section. This offers increased development efficiency and flexibility.

A critical aspect of building a microservice architecture is selecting the right framework. We compared Flask, Express, and Gin, leading backend frameworks known for their simplicity and minimal overhead, ideal for microservices.

To gauge performance we did some testing. We set up three different simple servers using the main frameworks we have decided to consider for our application. Each server ran a work load test with two threads and 100 connections for 30 seconds to test the different frameworks using various benchmarks. The results are seen below. {{img3}} The results tell a clear story how language speed affects the framework.

Flask is a Python-based framework, favored for its simplicity and flexibility. It's suitable for smaller services, but may fall short for speed-critical services. Express, a minimalist Node.js framework, is popular for microservices but may experience performance bottlenecks in high-demand systems. Gin, a Go language framework, is renowned for high performance but has fewer features and a smaller ecosystem.

For services like our User Service, where performance can be compromised for security and extensive DB support is available in the ecosystem, Flask is an appropriate choice. With our Event Service and Activity Service, a high-performance framework is needed due to request frequency. Gin, with its high efficiency and standard Go security, is an optimal selection.

Hopefully this case study provides some insight into the architecture design process, choosing an architecture and the right framework for each microservice requires understanding of each service's unique needs, enhancing the architecture's efficiency, security, and overall functionality.
