The backend architecture of the project I'm currently focused on, Community Compass, has been designed to not only provide clarity and ease of understanding in its functionalities, but to also allow scalability. This elegant structure enables the project with the capacity for swift and efficient expansion as required.

Community Compass' structure is broken down into three key components: {{line}}{{line}}

1. Database Communication: This segment revolves around Data Access Objects (DAO). DAOs are pivotal in managing the storage and retrieval of various data within the system. By abstracting and encapsulating all access to the data source, DAOs ensure a consistent and clean way of handling database operations in the service. {{line}}{{line}}

2. Request Handling: The primary focus here is managing incoming requests. Request handlers take in user requests, process them, and based on the logic, pass the appropriate actions either to the DAOs or to the internal communication services. They rely heavily on Data Transfer Objects (DTO) for parsing these requests and returning responses. {{line}}{{line}}

3. Internal Communication: The backbone of the microservice architecture, internal communication handles the complex logic of listening to and sending messages to the other different services and daemons in the system through a RabbitMQ message broker.

A simple layout of the implemented service can be seen below. {{img1}}

This specific backend architecture leverages key components to ensure seamless operation and scalability. For Internal Communication, it employs RabbitMQ as the message broker, enabling efficient asynchronous communication among services and daemons. For Database Communication, PostgreSQL, the relational database is used, providing sturdy and reliable data storage.

The Request Handler uses DTOs to form the backbone of communication, parsing and relaying requests. Domain Object (DO) logic is used by all 3 components independently, acting as the glue between the business logic and 3 service pieces.

This architectural design showcases the strengths of microservices, with distinct functional areas interacting in harmony. Itâ€™s a testament to selecting the right tools, and connecting in a way that provides a reliable, efficient system.
